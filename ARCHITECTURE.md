# Architecture

Document conversion API with 98-99% fidelity using local processing only.

## System Overview

```
API Client → Security → Document Service → Specialized Services → Response
                  ↓                    ↓
            IP whitelist      PDF, DOCX, XLSX, Images
            Rate limiting
            Input validation
```

## Processing Pipeline

1. **Security validation** (IP whitelist, rate limiting, input sanitization)
2. **Document preprocessing** (DOCX optimization for 98-99% fidelity)
3. **Format conversion** (LibreOffice with enhanced settings)

## Design Principles

- Single-engine design using LibreOffice
- Local processing only (no external APIs)
- Security-first with multiple validation layers
- Modular architecture with separation of concerns
